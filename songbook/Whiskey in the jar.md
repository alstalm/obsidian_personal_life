==G==As I was goin' over the ==Em==Cork and Kerry mountains  
I ==C==saw Captain Farrell and his ==G==money he was countin'  
I first produced my pistol and ==Em==then produced my rapier  
I said, ==C=="Stand and deliver, or the ==G==devil, he may take you"

**Chorus**
Mush-a ==D==ring, dum-a doo-dam-a-da  
==C==Whack for my daddy-o  
Whack for my daddy-o  
There's whiskey in the ==G==jar-o

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny  
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly  
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me  
But the devil take that woman, for you know she tricked me easy

**Chorus**

Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber  
Takin' my Molly with me and I never knew the danger  
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell  
I jumped up, fired off my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels

**Chorus**

Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'  
And some men like to hear the cannon ball a-roarin'  
And me, I like sleepin', 'specially in my Molly's chamber  
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain yeah

**Chorus**
