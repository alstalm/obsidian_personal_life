** Starts:** 


**Verse:**
==[A]==Almost heaven, ==Gbm==West Virginia,
==E==Blue Ridge Mountains, ==D==Shenandoah ==A==River.
Life is old there, ==Gbm==older than the trees,
==E==Younger than the mountains, ==D==growin' like a ==A==breeze. 

**Chorus**
==A==Country roads, take me ==E==home,
To the ==Gbm==place I ==D==belong: 
West ==A==Virginia, mountain ==E==momma, 
Take me ==D==home, country ==A==roads.

**Verse:**
==A==All my mem'ries, ==Gbm==gather 'round her, 
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, 
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye. 

**Chorus**
==A==Country roads, take me ==E==home,
To the ==Gbm==place I ==D==belong: 
West ==A==Virginia, mountain ==E==momma, 
Take me ==D==home, country ==A==roads.

**Bridge**

==Gbm==I hear her ==E==voice, in the ==A==mornin' hours she calls me,
The ==D==radio rem==E==inds me of my ==E==home far away.
And ==Gbm==Idrivin' down the ==G==Iroad,
I get a ==D==Ifeelin' that I ==A==should have been home ==E==yesterday,
yester==E7==day.

**Chorus**
==A==Country roads, take me ==E==home,
To the ==Gbm==place I ==D==belong: 
West ==A==Virginia, mountain ==E==momma, 
Take me ==D==home, country ==A==roads.

**Chorus 2:**
Oh, ==[C]== som$\downarrow$ewhere ==[Em]== over the rainbow  
==[F]== Blue...birds
