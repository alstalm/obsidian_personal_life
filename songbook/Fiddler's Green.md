**Verse 1:**
 ==\[A]==As I ==\[E]== walked by the dockside one evening so ==\[C#m]== fair  
To ==\[E]== view the salt waters and take in the salt ==\[B]== air  
I ==\[A]== heard an old fisherman ==\[E]== singing a song  
Saying, take me ==\[A]== away boys me ==\[E]== time is not ==\[B]== long

**Chorus:**
Wrap me ==\[E]== up in me ==\[B]== oilskin and ==\[E]== jumpers  
No ==\[A]== more on the ==\[E]== docks I'll be ==\[B]== seen  
Just ==\[A]== tell me old shipmates, I'm ==\[E]== taking a trip mates  
And ==\[B]== I'll see you ==\[F#]==someday on ==\[B]== Fiddlers ==\[E]== Green 

**Verse 2:**    
Now ==\[E]== Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard ==\[C#m]== tell  
Where the ==\[E]== fishermen go if they don't go to ==\[B]== hell  
Where the ==\[A]== skies  are all clear and the ==\[E]== dolphins do play  
And the ==\[A]== cold coast of ==\[E]== Greenland is far,  far ==\[B]== away

\[**Chorus**] 
**Verse 3:** 
When you're ==[E]== land on the dock and the long trip is ==\[C#m]== through  
There's ==\[E]== pubs and there's clubs and there's lassies there ==\[B]== too  
And the ==\[A]== girls are all pretty and the ==\[E]== beer it is free  
And there's bottles of ==\[A]== rum ganging ==\[E]== from on every ==\[B]==tree  
 
 \[**Chorus**] 
 
Now I ==\[E]== don't want a harp nor a halo, not ==\[C#m]== me  
Just ==\[E]== give me a breeze and a good rolling ==\[B]== sea  
And I'll ==\[A]== play me old squeeze-box as ==\[E]== we sail along  
With the wind in the ==\[A]== riggin to sing me a ==\[B]== song
