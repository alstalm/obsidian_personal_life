**TUNE:** C-G-C-G-C-E. capo on 2-nd freed
**Verse:** 
**Chorus:** 

I don't know if you can see
The changes that have come over me
In these last few days I've been afraid
That I might drift away
So I've been telling old stories, singing songs
That make me think about where I came from
And that's the reason why I seem
So far away today

**Chorus**
But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time  
Caledonia, you're calling me, and now I'm going home  
But if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad  
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

Oh and I have [moved](https://www.definitions.net/definition/moved) and I've kept on moving
Proved the [points](https://www.definitions.net/definition/points) that I [needed](https://www.definitions.net/definition/needed) proving
Lost the [friends](https://www.definitions.net/definition/friends) that I [needed](https://www.definitions.net/definition/needed) losing
Found [others](https://www.definitions.net/definition/others) on the way
Oh and I have [tried](https://www.definitions.net/definition/tried) and kept on trying
Stolen [dreams](https://www.definitions.net/definition/dreams) yes there's no denying
I have [traveled](https://www.definitions.net/definition/traveled) far with [conscience](https://www.definitions.net/definition/conscience) flying
Somewhere with the wind

[Chorus]

Now I'm [sitting](https://www.definitions.net/definition/sitting) here [before](https://www.definitions.net/definition/before) the fire
The [empty](https://www.definitions.net/definition/empty) room, the [forest](https://www.definitions.net/definition/forest) choir
The [flames](https://www.definitions.net/definition/flames) that [could](https://www.definitions.net/definition/could) not get any higher
They've [withered](https://www.definitions.net/definition/withered) now they've gone
But I'm [steady](https://www.definitions.net/definition/steady) thinking my way is clear
And I know what I will do tomorrow
When the [hands](https://www.definitions.net/definition/hands) are [shaken](https://www.definitions.net/definition/shaken) and the [kisses](https://www.definitions.net/definition/kisses) flow
Then I will disappear
