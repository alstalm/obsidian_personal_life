**TUNE:** C-G-C-G-C-E. capo on 2-nd freed
**Verse:** 
**Chorus:** 
**Verse 1** 
I don't know if you can see
The changes that have come over me
In these last few days I've been afraid
That I might drift away

**Verse 2** 
So I've been telling old stories, singing songs
That make me think about where I came from
And that's the reason why I seem
So far away today

**Chorus**
But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time  
Caledonia, you're calling me, and now I'm going home)  
But if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad  
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had  
  
**Verse 3**
have moved and I've kept on moving, proved the points that I needed proving
Lost the friends that I needed losing, found others on the way
I have tried and I've kept on trying, stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
I have traveled hard sometimes with conscience flying somewhere in the wind

**Verse 4**
Now I'm sitting here before the fire, the empty room, the forest choir  
The flames that couldn't get any higher, well they've withered, now they've gone  
But I'm steady thinking, my way is clear and I know what I will do tomorrow  
When the hands have shaken and the kisses flow, well I will disappear

**Verse 4** 
But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time  
Caledonia, you're calling me, and now I'm going home  
For if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad  
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
